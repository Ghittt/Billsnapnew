Test Results Analysis:
======================

USER DATA (from screenshot):
- Consumption: 3450 kWh/year
- Actual Bill: 1494€/year
- Current Provider: a2a energia

GPT-4O ANALYSIS:
- Used Consumption: 2700 kWh (WRONG - should be 3450!)
- Best Offer: Sorgenia NEXT ENERGY SMART
  - Energy Price: 0.107€/kWh
  - Fixed Fee: 9€/month
  - Simulated Cost: 567.3€/year
  - Savings: 332.7€/year

MANUAL CALCULATION (with correct 3450 kWh):
============================================
Energy Component:
- (3450 kWh × 0.107€) = 369.15€
- Fixed Fee (9€ × 12) = 108€
- Energy Total = 477.15€

System/Transport:
- (3450 kWh × 0.06€) = 207€
- Fixed = 35€
- System Total = 242€

Subtotal: 477.15 + 242 = 719.15€
+ 10% VAT: 719.15 × 1.10 = 791.07€

REALISTIC SIMULATED COST: ~791€
REALISTIC SAVINGS: 1494€ - 791€ = 703€/year (reasonable)

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
1. GPT used wrong consumption (2700 vs 3450)
2. Even with 2700, its calc (567€) is wrong:
   Should be: ((2700×0.107)+108 + (2700×0.06)+35) × 1.10 = 653€
   GPT returned: 567€
   
CONCLUSION: GPT is NOT following the formula properly.
